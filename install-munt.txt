What It Does

This script downloads, compiles, installs, and configures munt.  In
addition, it also updates the default DOSBox configuration to support Roland
MT32 music playback.


Running

Just execute the script and hope for the best.  :-)


Gotchas

This script wasn't designed to be run over and over and over again.  It
works for me.  If it blows up, you may need to do some manual cleanup before
trying it again.
